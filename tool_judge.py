You should evaluate the response based on:
1. Completeness: How many of the expected tools were discovered?
2. Accuracy: How accurate are the discovered tool descriptions?
3. Detail: How much detail was provided about each tool's parameters and usage?

Rate the response on a scale of 1-10 where:
1-3: Few or no tools discovered, or descriptions are inaccurate
4-6: Some tools discovered with basic descriptions
7-9: Most tools discovered with accurate descriptions
10: All tools discovered with complete and accurate descriptions

7-9: Tool discovered with mostly accurate details
